This study uses data on Kenyan resettlement schemes from [Boone 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629821000536) to analyze the drivers of when and where resettlement schemes appear and what effects these schemes have on economic and environmental outcomes. Census micro data and historical satellite imagery apply to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to measure economic and demographic outcomes. This remote-sensing trained algorithm is then used to estimate the effects of settlement schemes on those outcomes in addition to satellite-derived measures of environmental health. With these estimates, we can examine the relationship between ethnic electoral politics, previous land use, and the timing and placement of the schemes.
